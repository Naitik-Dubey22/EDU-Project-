## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Smart Contract Deployment:**
   - Contracts define reward logic and hold tokens for distribution.
   - Deployed on Ethereum or Polygon for low transaction costs.

2. **Player Registration:**
   - Players sign in using their crypto wallets (e.g., MetaMask).
   - A unique blockchain address identifies each player.

3. **Score Submission:**
   - Game servers submit scores to the platform via APIs.
   - Scores are validated and recorded on the blockchain.

4. **Leaderboard Updates:**
   - Leaderboard ranks are calculated in real-time based on on-chain data.
   - Players can view live rankings and historical performance.

5. **Rewards Distribution:**
   - At the end of each cycle, the top players receive crypto or NFT rewards.
   - Smart contracts handle payouts directly to wallets.
